- 👋 Hi, I’m @Crisnzx 
- Hello, my name is Cristovão,  I'm 17 years old, I'm from Brazil, my native language is Portuguese, but I can understand English too. I am "Técnico em Informática Integrado ao Ensino Médio" by "IFPB - Campus Esperança" and I started to study Computer Science at the "UFCG - Universidade Federal de Campina Grande" in 2021.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
- Currently, I have been studying HTML, CSS and JavaScript on my own over free classes on youtube, because my classes at the university haven't started yet because of the pandemic. I still don't know when my classes will start, while they don't start, I'll keep studying at home. I've studied Java and Node.js at "IFPB - Campus Esperança", so I have a little experience with these technologies.

- 👀 I’m interested in ...
- I intend to learn ReactJS after some months studying HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I am really focused in the front-end right now, however, my plan is to become a full-stack developer in the future.

- I look for projects that are focused on front-end development, with the technologies HTML, CSS, JavaScript or ReactJS.
